# Discord-NetEaseCloudMusic-RPC
<h1>Display the music which you are listening to on discord.</h1><br>
Feel free to fork it or whatever you what to change.<br>
Netease didn't ever provide a player SDK before, so I get window text as the music title.<br>
It's a better way to inject something into the cloudmusic to get the player state.<br>
<b>latest discord-rpc</b>(https://ci.appveyor.com/project/crmarsh/discord-rpc/build/artifacts)<br>
<h2>Usage</h2><br>
Just compile it and run, it will auto detect cloudmusic.<br>
